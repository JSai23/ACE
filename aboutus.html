      <h2 class="history_header">Our History</h4>
        <p class="history">Behind us there are many times that have shaped us, formed us and made us an effective and good organization<br>
                            We started back in the year of 2014 at the beggining of the annual school year. During this period we formed<br>
                            the club and got the basic ides up and running. We talked to our schools administrators and other facility<br>
                            so that we would be able to communicate with teachers so that we could start teaching. During this period we<br>
                            we only had about 5 to 7 members whow ere all just friends. During this year we only taught one or two times.<br>
                            Then in the year of 2016-2017 we decided to continue this idea from the open house of our school to get people<br>
                            to joing the club. At the first meeting we had over twenty kids from 5-8th grade interested in teaching.
